# Client Environment Variables (Vite)

# IMPORTANT:
# VITE_GRAPHQL_URL is baked into the frontend
# *at build time* — meaning you MUST update it
# before running `yarn build` for production.
#
# For local development, you typically point this
# to your local GraphQL server:
#
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
#
# For production, if your server and client are
# served from the SAME domain (recommended), use:
#
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=/graphql
#
# This makes the browser call:
#   https://your-domain.com/graphql
# instead of accidentally calling localhost.
#
# If you host the server separately, then set:
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=https://api.your-domain.com/graphql
#
# ============================================

# Default for local development:
VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
