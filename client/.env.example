# ============================================
# Client Environment Variables (Vite)
# ============================================
# IMPORTANT:
# VITE_GRAPHQL_URL is baked into the frontend
# *at build time* — meaning you MUST update it
# before running `yarn build` for production.
#
# For local development, you typically point this
# to your local GraphQL server:
#
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
#
# For production, if your server and client are
# served from the SAME domain (recommended), use:
#
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=/graphql
#
# This makes the browser call:
#   https://your-domain.com/graphql
# instead of accidentally calling localhost.
#
# If you host the server separately, then set:
#   VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=https://api.your-domain.com/graphql
#
# ============================================

# Default for local development:
VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql

# ============================================
# Auth0
# ============================================
# Get these from your Auth0 dashboard:
# - DOMAIN:      e.g. your-tenant.us.auth0.com
# - CLIENT ID:   SPA application client ID
# - AUDIENCE:    API identifier you configure
#
# Example audience:
#   https://ks-baseplate-api
#
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_spa_client_id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your_api_identifier
